        <p class="text">
          This particular example is exceptionally egregious. This was during
          the end of the fourth quarter in a crucial game when the referees who
          were standing right in front of Lebron missed a clear foul as he was
          hit on the arm on a layup that would have tied the game and sent them
          into overtime. This particular mistake by the refs sparked a wide
          conversation on how refs should be reprimanded for bad calls.

        />
        <p class="text">
          This example is another bad one that happened during a crucial moment.
          The original call by the refs was right in that Jaylen Brown was
          fouled. However, the opposing coach challenged this call for a review
          which resulted in the call being overturned. This is an especially bad
          mess up because the refs had the chance to slow down the footage and
          review it and yet still got the call wrong which was admitted by the
          NBA in a report the next day.
