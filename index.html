        What happened tonight, this is completely BS, This is [a] shame. Shame
        for the referees. Shame for the league to allow this. 23 free throws for
        them, and we get 2 free throws in the 4th quarter? How is it possible
        that Scottie Barnes, who is [an] All-Star caliber player in this league,
        he goes to the rim every single time with force and trying to get to the
        rim without flopping and not trying to get foul calls? He gets two free
        throws for the whole game. How is that possible? How are you going to
        explain that to me? They get to win tonight? If that's the case, just
        let us know so we don't show up for the game. Just give them a win. That
        was not fair tonight.
