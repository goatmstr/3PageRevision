        So what can be done to solve the continuous incompetence of referees in
        the NBA? To answer this, we have to look to the cause of the problem.
        There is a group of NBA fans who strongly believe that the refs have an
        ulterior motive for making bad calls such as gambling on the games they
        are officiating. Although this is possible and has been the case in the
        past, I personally don't think this is the case as this is seriously
        illegal. Regardless, the underlying problem is that referees more often
        than not, get to walk away freely whenever they make mistakes. An
        overaching solution is to simply reprimand referees when they make
        mistakes by cutting their pay or fining them. This way, they are held
        accountable for their mistakes just like players and coaches when they
        underperform.
